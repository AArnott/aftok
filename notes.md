It's impossible to make a living writing open-source software. Certainly, there
are exceptions; a few companies eke out a relatively spare existence selling
"enterprise support" licenses for free software, and lots of people employed by
private companies contribute to open-source products on time paid for by their
employer. Nonetheless, a great deal of the open-source software that developed
is a labor of love. OSS developers are artists, but they're fortunate that
their art is in a medium that also, at present, makes it easy enough to find
paid work that few of us have to starve while making our art.

Unlike many other arts (excepting music) open-source software development is 
frequently a deeply collaborative endeavor.
